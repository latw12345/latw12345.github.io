## Work Experience

### Research Assistant  
**Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Washington**  
November 2025 - Present

- Engineered an LLM-driven detection pipeline (Python, GPT APIs) capable of parsing mobile UI flows, extracting interface text, and classifying 12+ dark-pattern types using structured prompts, hierarchical reasoning, and multi-stage inference.
- Evaluated and optimized model performance using precision, recall, and F1 metrics on expert-labeled data, reducing false positives by 18% and improving cross-app robustness through prompt and constraint tuning.
- Designed, executed, and statistically analyzed behavioral user studies (N = 20+) to quantify how model-identified dark patterns influence user decisions, including task completion, consent behavior, and perceived autonomy.
- Built modular, reproducible data and visualization pipelines, standardizing multimodal datasets and delivering analysis-ready outputs used across the research team.

### Math Tutor  
**CLUE Tutoring, University of Washington**  
July 2025 - Present

- Delivered drop-in tutoring for 25+ undergraduates per week across calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra, with support for advanced topics such as linear optimization and mathematical modeling.
- Collaborated with faculty and fellow tutors to align instruction and create shared materials, increasing tutoring capacity and enabling support for approximately 15% more students per shift.
- Simplified complex mathematical concepts into real-world examples to improve comprehension and confidence across diverse learners.
- Provided bilingual tutoring (English and Chinese) to international students, bridging language gaps and enhancing understanding.

### Data Analyst Intern  
**Ogilvy One Data Team, Ogilvy Taiwan**  
July 2025 - August 2025

- Supported analytics and strategy projects for major clients including IKEA, Samsung, Volkswagen, Diageo, Taiwan Pay, and MSD Taiwan.
- Engineered production-grade SQL and Python ETL pipelines to automate extraction, cleaning, and aggregation across 5+ client datasets, reducing manual processing time by 30%.
- Performed A/B testing and segmentation analyses on SEO and web analytics data (GA4, Google Search Console), uncovering behavioral insights that increased CTR and engagement by 15%.
- Built interactive dashboards using Tableau, Power BI, and Looker Studio to enable self-serve insights across 10+ business categories.

## Selected Projects

### Washington State Electric Vehicle Adoption Analysis  
*R | Autumn 2025 | [Project Repository](https://github.com/latw12345/wa-ev-dashboard-full.git)*

- Built an end-to-end data pipeline integrating 4+ government datasets (EV registry, ACS, USDA), including ingestion, schema alignment, geospatial joins, and feature engineering for 20+ analytical variables.
- Developed modular, reproducible ETL components using dplyr and custom R scripts, implementing automated type enforcement, missingness detection, and constraint validation to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Developed a fully reactive analytics engine with synchronized filters, ranking vectors, and nearest-geometry detection, powering coordinated map, scatterplot, and comparison-table views.
- Added automated regression overlays and adaptive labeling logic to surface nuanced cross-county socioeconomic patterns.

### Hybrid Pet Product Recommender System for Dog Cat Star  
*Python, SQL | Summer 2025*

- Designed data ingestion and preprocessing pipelines for 10K+ product descriptions and 12K+ customer profiles using SQL and Python, standardizing raw tables into clean, analytics-ready schemas.
- Curated a bilingual tag ontology (EN/ZH) via Jieba segmentation and manual refinement, improving consistency and enabling richer feature engineering for downstream models.
- Built modular offline pipelines for collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, matrix factorization (SVD), and graph neural networks (LightGCN, PyTorch), with unified score normalization and caching layers.
- Evaluated on 12K+ customers at K = 20, achieving Recall@20 = 17.8%, Precision@20 = 4.3%, and MAP@20 = 7.2%, outperforming all baselines and achieving perfect Recall@20 for 407 users.
